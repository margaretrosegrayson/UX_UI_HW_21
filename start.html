        <h4 id="list-item-1">Beginner's Guide</h4>
        <p>Alongside weeps for lost five cheese pizza, new converts to veganism – who are also keen bakers - may find themselves mourning the lack of something as simple as vanilla cupcakes.

            But whilst your mozzarella guzzling days are behind you, you don’t need to give up your baking love—as this article will prove.
        
            Any baker will know the feeling. It’s Sunday evening and you fancy whipping up a cookie (to consume yourself obvs, don't kid yourself that these will last long enough to be consumed by your colleagues). Unfortunately, everything but the corner shop is closed and the cupboards are lacking in vegan 'essentials'.

            No problem for the average baker - butter, flour, eggs, sugar and milk are all easy to find - but egg replacers and vegan choc chips can be harder to locate. Despite common misconceptions, vegan baking doesn’t need to include complicated ingredients only found in the deepest corners of Whole Foods.</p>
        <h4 id="list-item-2">Vegan Substitions</h4>
        <h5>What can I substitute for a chicken egg?</h5>
        <p>In almost all cases, I recommend 1 small chicken egg per 1 flax egg. You can create a flax egg by combining one tbsp of ground flaxseed with 3 tbsp of water.
            
        <h5>What can I substitute for dairy milk?</h5>
        <p>Depending on the recipe, you can generally substitute any non-dariy milk alternative, such as almond milk, oat milk, or soy milk</p>

        <h5>What can I substitute for dairy buttter?</h5>
        <p>I typically substitute butter for vegan margarine, but you can also use applesauce or, in some cases, coconut oil.</p>
            
        <h5>Almond meal vs. almond flour. What’s the difference?</h5>
        <p>Almond meal is finely ground raw almonds, and almond flour is finely ground blanched and peeled almonds, making it finer in texture and lighter in color. The two can typically be used interchangeably in quick breads and cookies and is a great gluten-free alternative to traditional flours. But for recipes where a more cake-like consistency is desired, almond flour is definitely the way to go because of its lighter texture, color, and neutral flavor. You can see an example of where we used almond meal in these 5-Ingredient Vegan Gluten Free Cookies, and an example of where we used almond flour in this 1-Bowl Vegan Gluten Free Vanilla Cake.</p>
            
        <h5>I don’t want to use oil; what do you suggest to use to substitute oil in your recipes?</h5>
        <p>It depends on the recipe. If oil is an additive to say a sauce for texture or body, it can usually be subbed with water or vegetable broth, such as in pesto. When oil is called for sautéeing, it is more difficult to substitute. But I know some people have success skipping oil and just adding a little water to the pan instead. This will not provide the same crispy texture and may even result in some of your ingredients sticking to the pan, so experiment and see what works for you. In baked goods, oil can sometimes be substituted with applesauce or another fruit purée. However, know that every recipe is different and completely removing oil from a recipe will impact the end result. For roasting (vegetables and chickpeas, etc.), you can typically just skip the oil, but know that the ingredients will not come out as crispy and golden brown as they would with oil.</p>

        <h5>What can I substitute for rolled oats? I can’t tolerate them.</h5>
        <p>I’ve heard many readers have success substituting rolled oats for quinoa flakes in baking recipes. But this will obviously depend on each recipe (for instance, this wouldn’t work in the case of overnight oats since it’s predominantly oats). In baking, rolled oats can generally be substituted with a ½ + ½ blend of flour (gluten free or not), and almond meal. See the next few questions for more recommendations.</p>
                
        <h5>What can I substitute for oat flour?</h5>
        <p>I generally recommend substituting oat flour for spelt flour. But if you can’t have gluten, I would recommend substituting a ½ + ½ blend of almond meal and gluten free flour. See the next question for my go-to gluten free blends.</p>

        <h5>Can I use my own gluten free flour blend, or another brand not mentioned?</h5>
        <p>If I list a certain blend of gluten free flours, be sure to follow my recommendations for best results. If you want to try your own blend or a store-bought blend, feel free but I can’t guarantee the results. My go-to GF blend can be found here. If you’re looking for store-bought, Bob’s Red Mill 1:1 Gluten Free Baking Blend is my go-to and works in a variety of recipes. I’ve also heard great things about Pamela’s GF baking mix specifically for baking.</p>

        <h5>I’m not gluten free but the recipe calls for gluten-free flour. What can I substitute?</h5>
        <p>In almost all cases you can substitute the gluten-free flour blend for unbleached all purpose flour or whole wheat pastry flour.</p>

        <h5>What can I substitute for cashews?</h5>
        <p>Substituting cashews is a tricky one, so if at all possible, use cashews. This is because cashews make such a great creamy, neutral base for vegan desserts and sauces. However, you can try and substitute macadamia nuts in desserts for a similar result, or blanched almonds in savory recipes, like sauces.</p>

        <h5>What can I substitute for almonds/almond milk?</h5>
        <p>If you can’t have almonds and need a substitute for almond meal, try another nut meal, such as walnut meal, or a seed meal, such as finely ground sunflower seeds. If you’re trying to sub almond milk, see the next question.</p>

        <h5>Can I substitute soy or coconut milk for almond milk?</h5>
        <p>Soy and coconut will impart a soy or coconut flavor into recipes, which is why I prefer almond milk. However, soy and coconut beverage can be used in place of almond milk in most baking recipes. I wouldn’t recommend either in savory recipes, like pasta sauces. In most recipes, I’d recommend substituting almond milk for rice milk, because they’re equally neutral in flavor and have similar consistencies.</p>

        <h5>In recipes requiring peanut butter, is almond butter an equal substitute or would you recommend a different nut butter?</h5>
        <p>For the most part, yes. Most nut (and seed) butters work interchangeably. Just know that depending on the brand/type of nut or seed, the texture can be thicker or thinner, so you will need to adjust the other ingredients accordingly. And, as always, swapping out ingredients will almost always affect the flavor so keep that in mind!</p>

        <h5>I can’t have sugar. What can I substitute for cane sugar/coconut sugar/maple syrup?</h5>
        <p>Each recipe will behave differently when it comes to sugar changes. For instance, I wouldn’t recommend substituting a dry sugar, like coconut sugar, for maple syrup because it will throw off the ratio of wet:dry ingredients in the recipe. With that being said, you can generally substitute cane sugar for coconut sugar. And you can generally sub up to half of the sugar in any recipe with maple syrup or agave nectar. Another option would be stevia if you’re looking to avoid sugar altogether, but use far less as it’s quite potent. Sugar substitutions will obviously vary in each recipe, so use your discretion.</p>

        <h5>2-minute chocolate chip and pecan cookies</h5>
        <img src="images/cookies.jpg">
        <p>Serves 1<br><br>

            Ingredients<br><br>
            
            1 rounded tablespoon vegan butter<br>
            2 tablespoons soft brown sugar<br>
            1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
            1 tablespoon pecan nuts<br>
            4 tablespoons plain (all-purpose) flour<br>
            1 tablespoon dark chocolate chips<br><br>

            Method<br><br>
            
            1. In a microwave-safe bowl, spoon in the vegan butter and melt in an 850W microwave for 30 seconds.<br>
            
            2. Once melted, stir in the brown sugar, vanilla extract, pecan nuts, and plain flour to form a dough, then stir through the chocolate chips.<br>
            
            3. Spoon the mixture as a single cookie onto a microwave-safe plate, then microwave for 1minute 30 seconds until cooked.<br>
            
            NOTE: Many supermarkets sell dark chocolate chips that are accidentally vegan (check out the WH guide to accidentally vegan foods). If you don’t have any to hand, chop up two squares of a dark chocolate bar to use in place of the chocolate chips.</p>
        <h5>Vegan red velvet cake</h5> 
        <img src="images/red-velvet.jpg"> 
        <p>Serves 12<br><br>

            400 g (14 oz) gluten-free plain (all-purpose) flour<br>
            280 g (10 oz) rapadura sugar<br>
            1 tablespoon cacao powder<br>
            2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
            1 teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
            1 teaspoon ground sea salt<br>
            100 g (3 ½ oz) coconut oil, melted<br>
            240 g (8 ½ oz) frozen raspberries, warmed and mashed to a purée<br>
            110 g (4 oz) unsweetened apple-sauce<br>
            40 ml (1¼ fl oz) lemon juice<br>
            40 g (1 ½ oz) beetroot (beet) powder<br>
            1 tablespoon vanilla extract<br>
            100 g (3 ½ oz) fresh strawberries to garnish<br>
            130 g (5 oz) vegan white chocolate, melted<br>
            50 g (1 ¾ oz) coconut butter, melted<br>
            200 ml (7 fl oz) coconut cream<br>
            200 g (7 oz) desiccated coconut<br>
            1 tablespoon arrowroot starch<br>
            1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br><br>

            Method<br><br>

            1. Line the base and sides of two 20 cm wide x 7 cm deep (8 in ~ 2 ¾ in) round springform cake tins with baking paper. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C fan forced/350°F).<br>
            
            2. Mix the milk and apple cider vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside for 10 minutes.<br>
            
            3. In a large bowl, sift flour, sugar, cacao powder, baking powder, cream of tartar and salt.<br>
            
            4. To the milk mixture add the melted coconut oil, raspberry purée, apple sauce, lemon juice, beetroot powder and vanilla. Mix well.<br>
            
            5. Add the wet mixture to the dry and mix to combine, then evenly distribute the batter into the prepared cake tins.<br>
            
            6. Bake for 25–35 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean.<br>
            
            7. Let the cakes cool in the tins for 10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.<br>
            
            8. For the icing (frosting), mix all the ingredients in a high-speed blender or food processor until the icing is smooth and thick.<br>
            
            9. Sandwich the two cakes together using a third of the icing between the layers. Smooth the remaining icing over the entire cake and garnish with fresh strawberries. Slice and serve!<br>
            
            10. Store anything left in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days or sliced, wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 1 month.<br>
            
            NOTE: You can substitute 100 g (3 ½ oz) raw beetroot purée for the beetroot powder. If you take this option, you will have to reduce the raspberry purée to 140 g (5 oz) instead of 240 g (8 ½ oz).</p>
        <h5>Lemon meringue cupcakes</h5>  
        <img src="images/lemon_merigue_cupcakes__medium_4x3.jpg">
        <p>Makes 12<br><br>

            Ingredients<br><br>
            
            200 g (7 oz) gluten-free plain<br>
            (all-purpose) flour<br>
            2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
            2 tablespoons cornflour (cornstarch)<br>
            150 g (5 ½ oz) rapadura sugar<br>
            ½ teaspoon ground sea salt<br>
            250 ml (8½ fl oz/1 cup) rice milk,
            room temperature<br>
            80 g (2 ¾ oz) unsweetened applesauce<br>
            2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
            2 tablespoons lemon juice<br>
            1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest<br>
            125 ml (4 fl oz/½ cup) lemon juice<br>
            1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest<br>
            30 ml (1 fl oz) tinned coconut milk<br>
            1 tablespoon cornflour (cornstarch)<br>
            ¼ teaspoon turmeric<br>
            60 ml (2 fl oz/¼ cup) maple syrup<br>
            400 g (14 oz) tin salt-free chickpeas,
            chilled overnight<br>
            ½ teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
            145 g (5 oz) caster (superfine) sugar<br>
            ½ teaspoon vanilla extract<br><br>

            Method:<br><br>
            
            1. Preheat the oven to 170°C (150°C fan forced/340°F)<br>
            
            2. Line a 12-hole standard muffin tin with silicone cupcake liners.<br>
            
            3. In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, cornflour, sugar and sea salt together. In a separate bowl mix the rice milk, applesauce, vanilla extract, lemon juice and lemon zest. Add the wet mixture to the dry and fold through until just incorporated.<br>
            
            4. Fill the cupcake liners until they are three-quarters full.<br>
            
            5. Bake for 40–45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into a cupcake comes out clean. Stand for 5 minutes before turning out, topside up, onto a wire rack to cool. To make the lemon curd, combine all the lemon curd ingredients in a small saucepan over a medium–high heat.<br>
            
            6. Whisk continuously for 5–7 minutes or until the mixture is smooth and thickened. Remove from the heat and allow it to cool completely. Cut a deep hole in the top of each cooled cupcake with a small piping tip. Be careful not to cut through to the bottom of the cupcake.<br>
            
            7. Fill each hole with lemon curd. Drain the chickpeas and reserve 145 ml (5 fl oz) of chilled chickpea water (aquafaba) in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. You want the bowl to be completely clean and free of grease You can use lemon juice to clean the bowl and rinse before use.<br>
            
            8. Using an electric mixer with a whisk attachment, whisk the chickpea aquafaba and cream of tartar on medium speed until stiff peaks form.<br>
            
            9. Continue mixing and add the sugar one tablespoon at a time until it’s incorporated. Once all the sugar is added continue whisking for a further minute.<br>
            
            10. Add the vanilla and whisk for another 30 seconds. Spoon the meringue into a piping (icing) bag with a large star-shaped nozzle and pipe it onto the cupcakes. Place under a preheated grill until lightly golden, or use a small blowtorch to brown them. Serve immediately and enjoy!<br>
            
            NOTE: You can substitute the caster sugar in the meringue with 145 g (5 oz) of rapadura sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon of arrowroot starch. It will still work; however, it will produce a flatter meringue and a less airy texture.</p>
